    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hanger steak marinaded for several hours in a garlic and herbs</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, split in half and gently smashed with the side of a knife</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 cup roughly chopped fresh parsley leaves and steams</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh thyme, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 pounds hanger steak, cut into four 8-ounce steaks</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>To make the marinade</strong>: Combine the olive oil, garlic, peppercorns, fennel seeds, coriander seeds, parsley, thyme, and soy sauce in a small bowl and whish well. Season to taste with salt. Place the hanger steaks in a gallon-sized zipper-lock freezer bag, and the marinade, press out the air, and seal the bag. Allow the meat to marinate in the refigerator, turning occasionally, for at least 6 hours, and up to 24.</li>
        <li>Remove the meat from the marinade and wipe off the excess, incliding any whole spices, herbs, and garlic cloves. Heat the vegetable oil in a 12-inch cast-iron or heavy-bottomed stainless steel skillet over high heat until smoking. Carefully add the steaks and cook, flipping them freuently, until both sides have developed a light brown crust (if the oil starts to burn or smokes incessantly reduce the heat to medium-low), about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the butter and continue to cook, turning the steaks frequently and reducing the heat if the pan is smokeing excessively, until they are deep brown on both sides and the center registers 125&deg;F for medium-rare, or 135&deg;F for medium, on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer the steaks to a large plate and allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make a pan sauce if desired , or serve the steaks with a compound butter or Dijon mustard.</li>
    </ol>
